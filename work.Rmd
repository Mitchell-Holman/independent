## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
View(Boston)
Bo <- Boston
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }

set.seed(38)
index <- sample(nrow(Bo), size = (.5 *(nrow(Bo))))

test <- Bo[index, ]
trainb <- Bo[-index, ]






```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
mod <- lm(medv ~ . , data = trainb)

summary(mod)

tree1 <- rpart(mod, data = trainb)
pred_tree <- predict(tree1, newdata = test)
RSME_T <- sqrt(mean((pred_tree - test$medv)^2))
RSME_T



```

```{r}
rpart

```



```{r}
MSPEEE <- sqrt(mean(resid(mod)^2))
MSPEEE
```
